## About the API "[repository](https://github.com/LeenAlHarash/Portfolio-API)"
The portfolio includes a lightweight **FastAPI backend** used to demonstrate:
- REST endpoint structure
- Pydantic schema validation
- Swagger / OpenAPI documentation

The API is intentionally **static (no database)** and serves as a showcase of backend design rather than data persistence.
